# Image-segmentation
Background Segmentation Gaussian Mixture Models &amp; Deep Learning.

You will need to implement these models as described below, and both train and analyse them using our labelled
dataset. You will then need to write a 4 â€“ 6 page report on your findings using the IEEE proceedings doublecolumn LATEX template. You will also have to write a 1 page reflection discussing your experience of the
puzzle-solving process.
